Project Overview
This repository contains two key artifacts from my work in embedded systems development. These examples demonstrate my ability to design and implement interface software for hardware control, understand architectural considerations for embedded applications, and work with emerging systems technologies.
Artifact 1: Smart Thermostat Implementation
The first artifact is a Python implementation of a smart thermostat using a Raspberry Pi. This project integrates temperature sensing, user input through buttons, visual feedback via LEDs, and communication capabilities.
What problem did it solve?
This project addresses the need for an affordable, customizable smart thermostat solution. Commercial smart thermostats can be expensive and inflexible, while this implementation provides a platform that can be modified to suit specific needs. The system solves the basic problem of automated temperature control with manual override capabilities, visual feedback, and data logging.
Key Components:

Temperature/humidity sensing with an AHT20 sensor via I2C
User interaction through tactile buttons
Visual feedback via PWM-controlled LEDs and a character LCD display
UART communication for remote data logging
State-based operational modes (Off/Heat/Cool)

Artifact 2: Morse Code State Machine
The second artifact is a Python state machine implementation that displays messages in Morse code using LEDs. This demonstrates a more complex control system with proper state management and timing considerations.
What problem did it solve?
This project demonstrates how to implement a state machine for managing complex, time-dependent behaviors in embedded systems. It solves the problem of coordinating multiple outputs (different colored LEDs) with precise timing requirements to communicate information (Morse code) visually.
Key Components:

State machine implementation using the statemachine library
Visual output through differently colored LEDs
User input through a button for message switching
LCD display for user feedback
Multithreading for concurrent operations

Reflection
What did I do particularly well?
I implemented clean, well-documented code with extensive comments that make the functionality clear. The modular design in both projects demonstrates good software engineering practices. I effectively integrated multiple hardware components through different communication protocols (I2C, GPIO, UART) and implemented proper error handling and cleanup procedures. The state machine implementation shows an understanding of complex system behaviors and timing considerations.
Where could I improve?
There are several areas for improvement:

The thermostat code could benefit from more robust error handling, particularly for sensor failures.
Unit tests could be added to verify the functionality of individual components.
The Morse code implementation could be optimized for memory usage and performance.
Power management considerations could be better addressed for battery-operated scenarios.
A more sophisticated UI could improve user experience.

Tools and resources added to my support network:

Adafruit libraries for sensor integration
RPi.GPIO and gpiozero for GPIO management
statemachine library for implementing complex state-based behaviors
RPLCD library for character LCD control
Multithreading capabilities in Python for embedded applications

Transferable skills:

Hardware-software interface design
Real-time systems programming
State machine implementation and management
Multithreaded programming for embedded systems
Working with various communication protocols (I2C, UART, GPIO)
Proper documentation and code organization
Event-driven programming with interrupts

How I made these projects maintainable, readable, and adaptable:

Thorough Documentation: Both projects contain detailed comments explaining functionality, pin configurations, and design decisions.
Modular Design: Functionality is separated into discrete functions and classes that can be independently modified or replaced.
Consistent Naming Conventions: Variable and function names clearly indicate their purpose and follow consistent patterns.
Configuration Variables: Key parameters are defined as constants at the top of the files, allowing for easy modification without changing core code.
Error Handling: The code includes try/except blocks and cleanup procedures to ensure resources are properly released.
State-Based Design: Using explicit state machines and state transitions makes the code easier to understand and modify.
Object-Oriented Approach: Using classes to encapsulate related functionality improves organization and allows for future extensions.

These projects demonstrate my ability to work with embedded systems, interface with hardware components, and implement robust
